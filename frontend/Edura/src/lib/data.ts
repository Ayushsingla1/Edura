    summary: "Blockchain is a distributed, decentralized ledger technology that maintains a continuously growing list of records called blocks. Each block contains a timestamp and a link to the previous block, forming a chain. This technology enables secure, transparent, and tamper-resistant record-keeping without requiring a central authority.",
    keyPoints: [
      "Blockchain operates on a peer-to-peer network with no central authority",
      "Uses cryptographic techniques to ensure data integrity and security",
      "Transactions are verified by network nodes through consensus mechanisms",
      "Once recorded, data cannot be altered retroactively without altering all subsequent blocks",
      "Smart contracts are self-executing contracts with terms directly written into code"

        title: "What is Blockchain?",
        content: "Blockchain is a distributed ledger technology that creates an immutable record of transactions across a network of computers. Unlike traditional databases managed by central authorities, blockchain distributes identical copies of the ledger to all participants in the network. This decentralized structure eliminates the need for intermediaries while ensuring data integrity and security."
      },
      {
        title: "Key Components of Blockchain",
        content: "The fundamental components of blockchain include blocks (data containers), nodes (network participants), miners (validators), consensus mechanisms (agreement protocols), and cryptographic hashing (security measures). Each block typically contains transaction data, a timestamp, and a cryptographic hash of the previous block, creating a secure chain of information."
      },
      {
        title: "Distributed Ledger Technology",
        content: "As a form of distributed ledger technology (DLT), blockchain maintains multiple copies of the ledger across various locations. All participants have access to the same information, ensuring transparency and reducing the risk of fraud. Updates to the ledger must be agreed upon by the network through consensus, making unauthorized changes extremely difficult."
