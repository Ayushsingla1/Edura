## 🚀 Why Edura?

In today’s digital era, most e-learning platforms are passive, generic, and lack the motivation layer needed to drive long-term engagement. Learners drop off easily, educators lack visibility, and there’s no real accountability.

**Edura addresses this by combining:**
- 🤖 AI for adaptive content and interactivity
- 🔗 Blockchain for trust, ownership, and self-accountability
- 💰 Crypto incentives to reward learning and effort

It makes the learning journey active, rewarding, and radically transparent.

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. **Teachers** deploy a classroom smart contract with token entry requirement.
2. **Students** pay Edu-Tokens to enroll.
3. **AI** kicks in:
    - Transcribes lectures
    - Creates summarized notes and practice quizzes
    - Acts as a 24/7 voice tutor
4. **Optional Challenge:**
    - Student locks 20 EDU tokens
    - Sets a learning goal (e.g., "Complete Module 3 by April 30")
    - If successful → tokens returned
    - If failed → tokens lost
5. **Rewards & Records**:
    - Student performance stored immutably
    - Rewards issued for consistency, completion, and quiz wins
